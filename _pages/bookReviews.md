# Excellent books
## King, Kim N. C Programming: A Modern Approach. New York: Norton, 1996.
Well paced textbook with excellent practice problems at the end of each chapter.

## Singh, Simon. The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography. New York: Anchor Books, 1999.
Does a great job at explaining the story of codemakers vs codebreakers then uses this story to explain how modern day encryption works.
